# Memory Game  (blank)

This is a basic memory game that tests users using both sound and images, and has a random pattern every time. 

My first challenge begun once I decided to create my own random array instead of one static one. I was originally able to create a random array yet I realized that I was getting the same buttons repeatedly, and this didn't allow the game to be any fun. I was able to overcome this by creating a for function inside another for in order to compare the previous array with the current array and make sure it wasn't the same every time. I basically changed the number inside the array to a constant number so any time one had a repeated number, it would change it.  Another one of my difficulties was that then the game would load but nothing would light up, which really confused me. This made me realize that I was running a "0" button which didn't exist, so I made it impossible for this to occur. Both of these difficulties were simple logical mistakes that I just wasn't seeing after working on the code for so long, but after running several different approaches it finally made me realize that a simple comparison through for loops was the right way to go. I've used this method previously to alphabetize arrays in C++, so I knew that it would work perfectly with simple numbers. 

My main question about web development would be how do you deal with so many inputs from users at all moments, and always have a different approach for every moment no matter the users input. Do you need to create a function for all possible actions on the site, or are there short cuts that if any similar events happen then "this" will occur. I am also curious about what are the easiest ways to format a website, since CSS seems to have so many amazing features, yet I don't have much experience with it aside from simple text websites. 

With more time I would've loved to create different difficulty levels. I found that the constant "8" length of difficulty made me frustrated since I wished there was an easier length. I feel like other users can relate and want this difference when playing something dealing with difficulty. For example, my easy level would go slow and short, my middle level would speed up slightly and then be longer, and my hard level would quicken as the user gets better and be longer than the other ones. An infinite mode would also be cool to allow the user to see just how long they are able to remember all of the different elements.
